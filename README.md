# Water cut notify

![](images/2021-12-15-20-02-49.png)

Because ain't nobody got time to call a government call center.

## Usage
I'm too lazy atm so:

1. Fork the repo
2. Replace the region name in `water-cut-notify.sh`
3. (optional) you might want to inspect the JSON output in case you couldn't find your region. It pops up in a few attributes.
4. Set `LINE_TOKEN` repo secrets.
